# Mikuláš Štec - Fullstack Developer CV

Welcome to the repository for my personal CV,  This project serves as a showcase of my professional journey as a software developer.

The CV pulls its data dynamically from `Data.tsx`, making it easy to keep updated with the latest milestones.


## Features
- **Theme switcher:** Works with local storage and system settings. 
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience across all devices.
- **Next.js:** Leveraging the power of React.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find this repository informative and inspiring!


## Getting Started

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

The live version of the CV is deployed on Vercel and connected to a custom domain. The deployment process was incredibly smooth and took precisely 7 minutes from start to finish. Based on this experience, I highly recommend Vercel for anyone looking for an efficient deployment solution for their Next.js projects.
