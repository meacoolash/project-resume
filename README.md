# Mikuláš Štec - Fullstack Developer CV

Welcome to the repository for my personal CV,  This project serves as a showcase of my professional journey as a software developer.

Visit the live site: www.stec.sk

The CV pulls its data dynamically from `Data.tsx`, making it easy to keep updated with the latest milestones.

## Highlights

- **Next.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Theme switcher** (Works with local storage and system settings sync)
- **Responsive Design** 
- **Video previews with custom controls** 
- **Filtering Capabilities**
- **Print/PDF Functionality** (Download a streamlined PDF version with html2pdf integration)
- **Email Integration** (Formspree)


## Get Involved
Feel free to dig in. If you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to contribute, your input is welcome! Re-Use as you wish. 

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find this repository informative and inspiring!

## Deployment

The live version of the CV is deployed on Vercel and connected to a custom domain. The deployment process was incredibly smooth and took precisely 7 minutes from start to finish. Based on this experience, I highly recommend Vercel for anyone looking for an efficient deployment solution for their Next.js projects.


## Backlog and Future Enhancements
There are several enhancements on the horizon:

- **Reviews and Testimonials Section:** Introduce a section to display professional endorsements and feedback.
- **Filtering data on mobile:** Nice to have, however it's a tricky one from UX perspective
- **Refactor main page.tsx:** See comments in the code
- **Review the codebase:** Make the app perfect. Make the world better. But do not forget about finding balance between perfection and progress!
