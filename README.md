# Mikuláš Štec - Fullstack Developer CV

Welcome to the repository for my personal CV,  This project serves as a showcase of my professional journey as a software developer.

The CV pulls its data dynamically from `Data.tsx`, making it easy to keep updated with the latest milestones.

## Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find this repository informative and inspiring!

## Deployment

The live version of the CV is deployed on Vercel and connected to a custom domain. The deployment process was incredibly smooth and took precisely 7 minutes from start to finish. Based on this experience, I highly recommend Vercel for anyone looking for an efficient deployment solution for their Next.js projects.


## Backlog and Future Enhancements
There are several enhancements on the horizon:

- **Filtering data on mobile:** Nice to have, however it's a tricky one from UX perspective
- **Review the codebase:** Make the app perfect. Make the world better. But do not forget about finding balance between perfection and progress! 
- **Refactor Styling:** Cleanup components and tailwind classes.
